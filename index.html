                Hashtag activism is a term coined by media outlets which refers
                to the use of Twitter's hashtags for Internet activism. The term
                can also be used to refer to the act of showing support for a
                cause through a like, share, etc. on any social media platform,
                such as Facebook or Twitter. The point of hashtag activism is
                arguably to share certain issues with one's friends and
                followers in the hopes that they will also share the same
                information. This leads to a widespread discussion and allows
                for change to occur. However, hashtags have also been used to
                debate and make people aware of social and political issues.
                They can be seen as a way to help or start a revolution by
                increasing the number of supporters from across the world who
                have not been in contact with the issue. It allows people to
                discuss and comment around one hashtag. Hashtag activism is a
                way to expand the usage of communication and make it democratic
                in a way that everyone has a way to express their opinions.
